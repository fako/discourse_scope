       "   'Executive Summary',\n",
       "   'The danger that innocent people will be executed because of errors in the criminal justice system is getting worse. A total of 69 people have been released from death row since 1973 after evidence of their innocence emerged. Twenty-one condemned inmates have been released since 1993, including seven from the state of Illinois alone. Many of these cases were discovered not because of the normal appeals process, but rather as a result of new scientific techniques, investigations by journalists, and the dedicated work of expert attorneys, not available to the typical death row inmate.',\n",
       "   \"This report tells the stories of people like Rolando Cruz, released after 10 years on Illinois's death row, despite the fact that another man had confessed to the crime shortly after his conviction; and Ricardo Aldape Guerra, who returned to Mexico after 15 years on Texas's death row because of a prosecution that a federal judge called outrageous and designed to simply achieve another notch on the prosecutor's guns.\",\n",
       "   \"In 1993, the Death Penalty Information Center was asked by Representative Don Edwards, then Chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, to prepare a report on the problem of innocent people on death row. The Center 's report listed 48 defendants who had been released from death row in the prior 20 years because of subsequently discovered evidence of innocence. The growing number of additional cases in the ensuing years has prompted us to issue another report.\",\n",

Some courts have now taken the position that it is permissible for executions to go forward even in the face of considerable doubt about the defendant's guilt.\",\n",
       "   'The current emphasis on faster executions, less resources for the defense, and an expansion in the number of death cases mean that the execution of innocent people is inevitable. The increasing number of innocent defendants being found on death row is a clear sign that our process for sentencing people to death is fraught with fundamental errors--errors which cannot be remedied once an execution occurs.',\n",

       "   'Introduction',\n",
       "   'In mid-1993, the Death Penalty Information Center received a request from Rep. Don Edwards, then Chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, to prepare a report on the problem of innocent people on death row. At that time, crime bills were being introduced which involved an expansion of the federal death penalty and a curtailing of the capital appeal process. There also had been a series of highly publicized releases of people from death row in which it had belatedly been discovered that the wrong person had been convicted and sentenced to death.',\n",
       "   'The Center prepared a report for the Subcommittee, basing its research on its own monitoring of this issue and on groundbreaking work done by other researchers, most notably Professors Michael Radelet and Hugo Bedau.2The report listed 48 defendants who had been released from death row in the prior 20 years because of subsequently discovered evidence of innocence. It also explored why such critical mistakes had been made in the legal process, and whether it was likely that such errors would continue.',\n",
       "   \"The report was released as a Staff Report of Rep. Edwards's Subcommittee in October, 19933 and received considerable media coverage and public attention. It continues to be widely cited. The Appendix to this Report contains the original list of 48 cases of people released from death row because of evidence of their innocence.\",\n",
       "   'The Need for a New Report',\n",
       "   'The problem of innocent people facing execution because of errors in the criminal justice process has in no way diminished since 1993. For example, in the summer of 1996, the state of Illinois dropped all charges against four men who had been convicted of a 1978 murder. Two of the men had been sentenced to death. The investigation which led to the discovery that the wrong men had been convicted was conducted by three journalism students who had been assigned the case in class. These releases came on the heels of the release from death row of two other men in Illinois, Rolando Cruz and Alejandro Hernandez. Three former prosecutors have been indicted for obstruction of justice in that case. Although the public may have learned something about these dramatic reversals, they probably have heard little about the continuous string of mistakes in capital cases which throws doubt on the reliability of the entire death penalty process.',\n",
       "   \"There is considerable evidence that the crisis of wrongful death penalty convictions has worsened: the annual average of people released from death row because of their innocence has increased since the first report was prepared, while the opportunity to appeal and to raise newly discovered evidence of one's innocence has recently shrunk dramatically. The federal funding for the death penalty resource centers, which helped discover and vindicate several of the innocent people cited in this report, has been completely withdrawn. Some courts have now taken the position that it is permissible for executions to go forward even in the face of considerable doubt about the defendant's guilt. Yet, recent research indicates that there may be a greater chance of mistaken convictions in death cases than in non-death cases.4\",\n",
       "   \"Part I of this report discusses why so many innocent defendants are being found on our nation's death rows and the prospects for lessening the danger of mistaken executions in the future. Part II lists the new releases from death row and also discusses additional cases which may be added to the list when the cases are concluded.\",\n",
       "   'Part I: The Danger of Mistaken Executions',\n",
       "   'Pace of Innocent Cases Increases',\n",
       "   \"Since Innocence and the Death Penalty: Assessing The Danger of Mistaken Executions was released in 1993, 21 more cases have been added to the list of mistaken convictions in capital cases. Seventeen of those releases occurred after the original report's release, and the other four were cases which would have been included in the original report had the information about these releases been known earlier. In the twenty-one-year span of the first report, there was an average of 2.5 releases of innocent defendants per year from 1973 to 1993. The 17 releases over the past three and a half years represents a pace of 4.8 releases per year, almost twice the pace of the previous report.\",\n",
       "   'For the original 48 cases, it took an average of approximately six and a half years between conviction and eventual release. With the 21 additional cases included in this report, the average time spent on death row before release is now about seven years. This length of time is important because both state and federal legislation in recent years will shorten the length of time death row inmates have before their execution. Currently, the average time between sentencing and execution is eight years5. If that time is cut in half, then the typical innocent defendant on death row will be executed before it is discovered that a fatal mistake has been made.',\n",
       "   'Reasons for Increased Risk of Error',\n",
       "   'The most obvious reason for the increase in the number of innocent cases being discovered among those on death row is the overall expansion of the death penalty. The number of people on death row has been increasing6, and this expansion is likely to continue as states and the federal government broaden the death penalty to new crimes, and new states such as New York and Kansas begin sentencing people to death. With the greater use of the death penalty, there is a greater likelihood of mistakes.',\n",
       "   \"Secondly, the death penalty has become even more political as legislators, prosecutors, and even judges promote the death penalty in their campaigns7. This results in the expansion of death penalty crimes and a shorter and narrower appeal process. Prosecutors, with virtually unbridled discretion to seek the death penalty, may pursue a death sentence even when the evidence is weak, and they may be reluctant to change course when contradictory evidence later arises.8 Even judges, many of whom are also subject to elections, can be influenced in their decisions to ignore evidence of innocence unless it is absolutely irrefutable. And recent changes in the appeals process, especially in federal courts, have made it more likely that executions will proceed even in the face of evidence raising doubts about a defendant's guilt.9\",\n",
       "   'For many years, the ABA has conducted studies, held educational programs, and produced studies and law review articles about the administration of the death penalty. As a result of that work, the Association has identified numerous, critical flaws in current practices. Those flaws have not been redressed, indeed, they have become more severe in recent years, and the new federal habeas law and the defunding of the [resource centers] have compounded these problems. This situation requires the specific conclusion of the ABA that executions cease, unless and until greater fairness and due process prevail in death penalty implementation. -Report in support of American Bar Association Resolution, 199710',\n",
       "   'Professor Samuel Gross, a noted author and researcher at the University of Michigan Law School who has written extensively about capital punishment, recently explored the reasons why mistakes are more likely in capital cases than in other criminal matters.11 Among the reasons he gave in support of this thesis are:',\n",
       "   '• The great pressure on police and prosecutors to \"solve\" the most notorious murders in a community',\n",
       "   'When a police officer is killed or a child brutally raped and murdered, the public is watching every day until a suspect is produced. The terrible murder of 10-year-old Jeanine Nicarico in a Chicago suburb in 1983 at first resulted in months of frustration with no indictments. Eventually, the police and prosecutors settled on the wrong suspects: Rolando Cruz and Alejandro Hernandez. Even though their convictions and death sentences were repeatedly overturned on appeal, the prosecutors continued to retry them. They were not officially cleared and released until 1995. Now three prosecutors and four police officers have been indicted for obstruction of justice in this prosecution.12',\n",
       "   '• Lack of eyewitness testimony',\n",
       "   'When someone is murdered by a stranger, which is often the case in death penalty crimes, there is rarely an eyewitness to the killing. Thus, in prosecuting the case the state relies more heavily on less reliable sources of evidence such as accomplices, jail-house snitches, and pressured confessions from the defendant. The real killer has a strong motivation in a capital case to divert attention from himself and to put the onus, in whole or in part, on another individual who may be completely innocent. Randall Dale Adams, whose saga was portrayed in the documentary, The Thin Blue Line, faced execution in Texas because the real killer, a young man with good family connections in Texas, was able to convince authorities that the outsider, Adams, must have been the killer.',\n",
       "   'A confession by the defendant is not a dependable indicator of guilt.13 Manipulation and pressure by the police, or the presence of mental retardation or mental illness on the part of the defendant can lead an innocent suspect to be overly cooperative with the authorities by supplying information the police obviously want to hear.',\n",
       "   '• Heightened publicity',\n",
       "   'At trial, the heightened publicity surrounding capital cases can influence jurors by supplying them with information that may be inadmissible, misleading, and inflammatory. Such jurors may be swept up in the communal outrage about the crime as conveyed by the media, making them more likely to ignore legitimate doubts raised by the defense.',\n",
       "   '• Death qualified juries',\n",
       "   'Juries in death penalty cases are always quizzed about their attitudes on capital punishment before the start of the trial. Those who could not impose a death verdict are eliminated from the jury pool. According to many studies, the resulting \"death-qualified\" jury is not only prepared to return a death sentence, but is more likely to erroneously convict the defendant in the first place.14 The very raising of the issue of what the punishment will be before the trial can send a signal to prospective jurors that the issue of guilt is in little doubt.',\n",
       "   '• Limited resources of the defense attorney',\n",
       "   \"Defense counsel in a capital case must not only prepare for the guilt/innocence phase of the trial, but also simultaneously ready themselves for the sentencing phase. Since the defense's resources are often severely curbed by state spending limits, the attorney must decide whether it would be better to risk the client's conviction but save his life by spending more time preparing for the sentencing phase. If this preparation occurs at the expense of investigating evidence which might produce an acquittal, it heightens the chance that a mistaken conviction will result.\",\n",
       "   'Verneal Jimerson (IL), released 1996; photo: Loren Santow',\n",
       "   '• Heinousness of death penalty cases',\n",
       "   'Related to the problem of pre-trial publicity is the heinousness of the typical death penalty case. Regardless of whether the jurors heard such evidence before the trial, they will certainly be exposed to it during the trial. The heinousness of the facts alone can make it more likely that the jury will ignore reasonable doubts and return a guilty verdict. Releasing a defendant who is probably guilty (but not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt) of a brutal slaying is much more difficult than releasing someone who is probably guilty of only a misdemeanor. Professor Gross acknowledges that there are countervailing pressures which may make a mistake less likely in a capital case, such as more thorough representation by the defense and more careful review of the case on appeal. But, he notes, these measures are unevenly applied. In many states, the amount of money offered for defending a capital case is totally inadequate and requests for co-counsel, expert testimony and pre-trial investigations are routinely turned down. Similarly, the appeals process is being sharply curtailed, meaning that adequate time will not be available to discover mistakes. Thus, Professor Gross concludes:',\n",
       "   \"The steady stream of errors that we see in cases in which defendants are sentenced to death is a predictable consequence of our system of investigating and prosecuting capital murder. . . . At best, we could do an imperfect job of catching errors after they occur, and in many cases we don't really try. As a result, most miscarriages of justice in capital cases never come to light.15\",\n",

       "   'After the U. S. Supreme Court overturned existing death penalty statutes in 1972, many states wrote statutes which closely paralleled the recommendations of the American Law Institute\\'s (ALI) Model Penal Code.17 Indeed, in Gregg v. Georgia, which gave approval to some states\\' new statutes, the Court specifically referred to the Model Penal Code as a source for constructing an acceptable statute.18 In this code, there was an attempt to minimize mistaken executions by allowing the trial court to withhold a death sentence if the evidence left some doubt about the defendant\\'s guilt. These drafters realized the lingering possibility of innocence despite a conviction \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The Model Penal Code contained the following provision:',\n",
       "   '§ 210.6 Sentence of Death for Murder; Further Proceedings to Determine Sentence.',\n",
       "   '(1) Death Sentence Excluded. When a defendant is found guilty of murder, the Court shall impose sentence for a felony of the first degree [i.e., a non-death sentence] if it is satisfied that:',\n",

       "   'The ALI explained the need for such a provision in its Commentary to this subsection:',\n",
       "   '[S]usbsection (1)(f) . . . is an accomodation to the irrevocability of the capital sanction. Where doubt of guilt remains, the opportunity to reverse a conviction on the basis of new evidence must be preserved, and a sentence of death is obviously inconsistent with that goal.20',\n",
       "   \"Unfortunately, although many states employed a list of aggravating and mitigating circumstances for capital cases similar to the Model Penal Code's suggestions,21 no state or federal jurisdiction has adopted this protection against the execution of the innocent. In light of the heightened danger of error in capital cases, and because it has become apparent that these errors are more pervasive than previously realized, it is imperative to at least amend existing statutes in line with the Model Code's recommendations. An additional revision would be needed to allow appellate courts to take similar action when evidence of innocence does not emerge until well after the trial.\",\n",
       "   'Besides the critically important goal of saving innocent lives, such legislative changes could quickly eliminate from the lengthy death penalty appeals process some of the most troubling and time-consuming cases, i.e., those approaching execution with a legitimate claim of innocence. This would save the criminal justice system both time and money.',\n",
       "   'Innocence on Appeal',\n",
       "   'Once a defendant has been found guilty at trial, the presumption of innocence is shed and replaced with a presumption of guilt. The appeals process is not directly concerned with whether the jury made a mistake in its verdict, but rather focuses on the procedures which were followed in the trial leading up to that verdict. Most states have stringent time limits on presenting the court with new evidence of one\\'s innocence.22 For example, under Virginia\\'s \"21-day rule,\" the defendant must present new evidence of his innocence within 21 days of his conviction in order for it to be considered by the courts on appeal.23 Likewise, federal courts reviewing a state capital case review only constitutional violations and not new factual evidence pointing to innocence.24',\n",

       "   \"When Leonel Herrera's attorneys tried to introduce evidence that his brother Raul had confessed to the crime for which Leonel was facing execution, the federal courts concluded that such evidence was irrelevant to their deliberations. Such claims, the Court said, should be raised in a clemency petition--an unlikely source of relief for someone like Herrera accused of killing a police officer in Texas. The Court did leave open the remote possibility that the Constitution bars the execution of someone who conclusively demonstrated that he was actually innocent,25 but such cases will be rare or non-existent. Of one thing, however, I am certain. Just as an execution without adequate safeguards is unacceptable, so too is an execution when the condemned prisoner can prove that he is innocent. The execution of a person who can show that he is innocent comes perilously close to simple murder. -Justice Harry Blackmun, Herrera v. Collins, 199326\",\n",
       "   'When Paris Carriger brought both his constitutional and innocence claims before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, he was still denied relief. The chief witness against Carriger was a police informant, Robert Dunbar, who was given immunity for three felonies in exchange for his testimony. Later Dunbar admitted that it was he, not Carriger, who had committed the murder and that he had lied at the trial. He even admitted his guilt in court and again just before his death. 27(Dunbar was inconsistent in his recantation, at times taking back his admission of guilt.)',\n",
       "   'When a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals reviewed this new evidence, they concluded that, \"Dunbar\\'s recantation does, however, show his general unreliability as a witness. . . . We therefore entertain serious doubts about Dunbar\\'s credibility, and these doubts are particularly troubling because the government relied heavily on Dunbar\\'s testimony in prosecuting Carriger.\"28 Doubt about the government\\'s chief witness led to doubt about Carriger\\'s guilt: \"[W]e acknowledge,\" the court wrote, \"that Carriger is not unquestionably guilty. Compared to many other capital cases we have seen, the evidence of guilt here is not overwhelming.\" However, the court would still not grant Carriger any relief: \"The thinness of the prosecutor\\'s case, however, is an insufficient basis on which to grant relief under Herrera and its progeny, which put the burden on the petitioner to show he is unquestionably innocent. This Carriger has not done.\"29 Clearly, innocent defendants face a daunting task in trying to avoid execution under this standard.',\n",
       "   'Joseph Payne faced a similar dilemma on the eve of his scheduled execution in Virginia in November, 1996. Numerous eyewitnesses to the crime of which he was accused had come forward after his trial to testify that Payne was not involved in the prison murder. Here, too, the courts acknowledged their doubts about Payne\\'s guilt. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals acknowledged that Payne offered \"copious evidence\" in his favor and \"a wealth of evidence\" that the chief witness against him was \"an appalling and known prevaricator.\"30 But those doubts were not enough for it to issue a stay from his pending execution. Fortunately, because of the doubts about his guilt, the Governor of Virginia stepped in just a few hours before the execution and commuted Payne\\'s sentence to life.31',\n",
       "   'The critical factor regarding evidence of innocence in a capital case is timing. If one is fortunate enough to have competent counsel and the resources to thoroughly investigate the case before trial, and if the necessary evidence of innocence is available then, there is a chance that a conviction and death sentence can be avoided. On the other hand, if the competent counsel or the new evidence does not become available until after trial, the same evidence will often be rejected on technical procedural grounds.',\n",

       "   \"The case of Lloyd Schlup starkly illustrates the change which is taking place in the courts' assessments of claims by death row inmates that they are innocent. Schlup, whose conviction and death sentence were upheld by all the Missouri courts which reviewed them, was finally given the chance to prove his innocence and his trial lawyer's incompetence when the United States Supreme Court corrected a lower court's overly narrow approach to the degree of proof needed on a claim of innocence.32 However, shortly thereafter, Congress passed the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996,33 which discarded the Supreme Court's standard and replaced it with one that is virtually impossible to meet.\",\n",
       "   \"The federal District Court judge reviewing the overwhelming evidence of innocence in Schlup's case granted him a new hearing in accordance with the Supreme Court's guidelines. But, the judge noted, if other standards (equivalent to those now imposed by Congress) had applied to Schlup's case, he would not have gotten relief.34 Thus, Congress has surely sealed the fate of some innocent defendants whose cases will arise under the new law. They will be executed despite evidence of innocence which would be troubling to any reasonable juror.\",\n",

He kept repeating to the judge that he did not know the law and had no attorney to represent him.35 Despite this blatantly unbalanced contest, the judge proceeded with the hearing and subsequently denied Mr. Gibson's appeal.\",\n",

       "   'Recent Cases of Possible Mistaken Executions',\n",
       "   'Since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, there have been inmates with reasonably credible claims of innocence who were nevertheless executed, some without a full review of those claims. In 1992, for example, Roger Keith Coleman made headlines with his dual plea that he was innocent and that no court would review his evidence.40',\n",
       "   \"Coleman's representation at trial was shoddy. On appeal, his new attorneys misread the state statute governing the time for submitting an appeal and filed their brief a day too late. The Virginia state courts held that this late filing was the same as no filing and refused to review his issues. The federal courts then said that he could not raise a federal claim because he had waived his state review. Finally, the Supreme Court said that he could not complain that it was his attorney who erred, since he was not entitled to an attorney in the first place.41 Coleman was executed without a full review of his innocence claims.\",\n",
       "   'Leonel Herrera may have been innocent, but he was not innocent enough to satisfy the Supreme Court.42 A former Texas judge submitted an affidavit stating that another man had confessed to the crime for which Herrera was facing execution. Numerous other pieces of new evidence also threw doubt on his conviction. Still, the Court said that at this late stage of his appeal, he needed an extraordinary amount of proof to stop his execution. He was executed in Texas in 1993.',\n",
       "   \"Another kind of innocence was illustrated in the case of Jesse Jacobs, who was executed in Texas on January 4, 1995.43 Jacobs had been convicted and sentenced to death after the state had put on evidence to show that he was the actual killer in an abduction ending in murder which also involved a co-defendant. At the later trial of the co-defendant, the state reversed its story and said it was the co-defendant, not Jacobs, who pulled the trigger. In fact, the prosecution used (and thus vouched for) Jacobs's own testimony that he did not do the shooting and did not even know that his co-defendant had a gun. The co-defendant was also convicted, though not sentenced to death. Despite the admission by the prosecution that the arguments they made at Jacobs's trial were false, Jacobs was executed.\",\n",
       "   'Jacobs was not innocent in the full sense of the word. He had admittedly participated in the underlying crime, but it is doubtful that the jury would have sentenced him to death if the prosecutors had acknowledged that he was not directly involved in the actual murder. Three Supreme Court Justices were highly critical of this deception on the prosecution\\'s part. Justice Stevens wrote: \"It would be fundamentally unfair to execute a person on the basis of a factual determination that the state has formally disavowed. I find this course of events deeply troubling.\"44',\n",
       "   'Senator Arlen Specter, an ardent death penalty supporter and former district attorney, was also distressed at this development, and in addressing the Senate he warned against such impositions of the death penalty in \"a callous or unreasonable fashion.\"45 The European Parliament likewise passed a resolution expressing \"shock\" at this execution; there were no votes opposing the resolution.46',\n",
       "   'The recent execution of Coleman Wayne Gray in Virginia is another example of improper state tactics used to tip the balance toward a death sentence. At the time of Gray\\'s sentencing hearing, the state circumvented the rules of disclosure and at the last minute raised the prospect of other notorious offenses by Gray (even though he had not been charged in these alleged offenses). With no chance to adequately refute these allegations, Gray was sentenced to death. Federal District Court Judge James Spencer found the state\\'s action unfair, but found himself constrained by the new Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 from granting Gray any relief. He wrote: \"One cannot morally support the death penalty without some assurance, by evidence or faith, that the ultimate penalty is imposed fairly.\" Gray was executed on February 26, 1997.47',\n",
       "   'Does the System Work?',\n",
       "   'The fact that so many cases of innocent people on death row have been overturned could convey the impression that the appeals system in capital cases prevents a fatal mistake from being made. However, a review of why many of these mistakes were discovered leads to a very different conclusion.',\n",
       "   \"Randall Dale Adams's innocence was primarily established when an independent film maker, Errol Morris, went to Texas to do a documentary on the infamous psychiatrist who repeatedly testified for the state that each defendant he considered presented an ongoing threat to society and hence should be executed. The course of that documentary took an unusual turn when the real killer confessed to the crime. The resulting movie, The Thin Blue Line, was a critical factor in Adams's release.48\",\n",
       "   'Clarence Brandley was convicted of murder and rape in a racially charged case in Texas. Fortunately, the civil rights community mounted a major effort to prove his innocence, and a 60 Minutes documentary added to the considerable doubt about the veracity of the original trial. Brandley was exonerated, but such resources, though critical, are not available to most death row defendants.49',\n",
       "   'Kirk Bloodsworth was exonerated in Maryland because DNA testing became available years after his trial. This was a fortuitous scientific development, not the normal workings of the appeals process.50',\n",
       "   \"Similarly, recent reversals such as those of Rolando Cruz, Alejandro Hernandez, Verneal Jimerson and Dennis Williams were all helped by the development of DNA testing. In the case of Cruz and Hernandez, the state continued to prosecute them despite the fact that another man had confessed to the crime and the evidence against them was unreliable. One assistant in the Attorney General's office resigned rather than continue the prosecution of these men. But the state pressed on, partly under the guidance of a prosecutor who became the State's Attorney General. Now both inmates are free, with all charges dropped. Three former prosecutors and four police officers have been indicted for obstruction of justice in this case.51\",\n",
       "   'Fortunately, Cruz and Hernandez were assisted by an excellent defense team, including experts from Northwestern University Law School and well-known author Scott Turow. Considerable media attention over many years also aided the defendants in this case. Clearly, if their appeals had run out four or five years after their convictions, they would be dead today instead of free.',\n",
       "   'Verneal Jimerson and Dennis Williams were involved in another Illinois case involving four defendants. All have been freed, and the state has admitted that it prosecuted the wrong defendants. The breakthrough came when a journalism professor, David Protess, assigned the case to some of his students. They reinvestigated, discovered that the wrong men had been convicted, and supported their findings with DNA testing.52 The journalistic review process worked well--the appeals process had not.',\n",
       "   'System Now Lacks Critical Resources',\n",
       "   'Some of the most effective work of reinvestigating capital cases leading to new trials and releases from death row was done in recent years by the death penalty resource centers. These centers were created during the Reagan administration to assist attorneys in the complex area of capital appeals. They worked on death penalty cases full-time and shared their expertise with others. Condemned inmates such as Walter McMillian in Alabama, Lloyd Schlup in Missouri, Curtis Kyles in Louisiana, Andrew Golden in Florida and Federico Macias in Texas had their convictions overturned either through direct resource center representation or with their help.',\n",
       "   'Today, however, all federal funding for the 20 resource centers has been withdrawn. Most of these centers have closed. Some continue with reduced staff, no longer able to offer even temporary representation to the thousands of death row inmates. Yet the appeals system is only as effective as the attorneys who bring the cases before the courts. Some states, such as Georgia, Mississippi and Louisiana, provide no defense money for state post-conviction appeals. Volunteer lawyers and large law firms willing to take these cases for free are largely tapped out. The appeals system has been shortened and significantly narrowed over the past few years. Now, adequate representation for even this curtailed process is doubtful in many cases. Some inmates will continue to benefit from excellent and experienced attorneys who invoke the legal process, and even the media when necessary, to expose the injustices which led to wrongful convictions. But there is no reliable system which ensures that everyone facing execution will have anywhere near that kind of help. New people will be released from death row each year, but many more will be executed, and it is increasingly likely that some of those killed are innocent.',\n",
       "   'Scope of the Problem',\n",
       "   'Since 1973, approximately 6,000 people have been sentenced to death.53 During this same period, 69 people have been released from death row with substantial evidence of their innocence. This translates to a rate of over 1 innocent death row inmate for every 100 death sentences. As the analysis above indicates, the rate may be considerably higher, since extraordinary efforts are generally needed to free a death row inmate, and most inmates do not have those extra resources available to them.',\n",
       "   'Professors Radelet and Bedau reported 416 cases this century of mistaken convictions in \"potentially capital cases,\" that is, those whose crime could merit the death penalty, assuming such a law was in place.54 While those authors point out that there probably have been many other erroneous convictions, their rate of about 4.5 innocent persons convicted each year in capital cases is comparable to the rate of 4.8 persons per year released from death row in recent years. This is some indication that the problem of critical mistakes in capital cases is persistent and very difficult to eradicate.',\n",
       "   'Another view of the scope of the problem of error in the criminal justice system is contained in a 1996 Department of Justice Report on the use of DNA evidence. The report catalogs numerous cases, mostly from the late 1980s, in which previous convictions were overturned upon DNA testing. Some of these cases involved defendants on death row.55',\n",
       "   'In commentary accompanying the report, Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck note how often the police focus on the wrong suspect:',\n",
       "   \"Every year since 1989, in about 25 percent of the sexual assault cases referred to the FBI where results could be obtained . . . the primary suspect has been excluded by forensic DNA testing. . . . The fact that these percentages have remained constant for 7 years, and that the National Institute of Justice's informal survey of private laboratories reveals a strikingly similar 26-percent exclusion rate, strongly suggests . . . underlying systemic problems that generate erroneous accusations and convictions.56\",\n",
       "   'The fact that 1 out of 4 defendants accused of a serious crime such as sexual assault is innocent, or that at least 1 out of 100 of those actually sentenced to death is innocent, is disturbing. Certainly, such a record would be totally unacceptable for a car company whose cars were so defective that they caused fatal crashes in 1 out of 100 vehicles. Some would conclude that since death penalty errors are completely avoidable by switching to a sentence of life without parole, the capital punishment process should be stopped all together. Others, like the American Bar Association, have concluded that at the very least such evidence demands that capital cases be given the most thorough and careful attention that the legal system can provide if the death penalty is to continue at all. They recently concluded that the present system does not provide adequate protections and that executions should be stopped.57',\n",
       "   'Conclusion',\n",
       "   \"The risk that innocent people will be caught in the web of the death penalty is rising. The increased rate of discovery of innocent people on death row is a clear sign that, even with the best of intentions, the criminal justice system makes critical errors--errors which cannot be remedied once an execution occurs. Courts are allowing executions to go foward even in the presence of serious doubts about the defendant's guilt. The current emphasis on faster executions, less resources for the defense, and an expansion in the number of death cases means that the execution of innocent people is inevitable.\",\n",
